This code contains the source code that runs on the puppet people
marionette robots.  Each robot has wireless contact with a master
computer via an XBee network.  An onboard PIC32 handles odometry,
wireless communication, and PID loops for 4 channels of DC motor PWM.

The code requires a version of the pic32-gcc compiler to compile.
Although the .hex file produced by compilation is the file that is
actually loaded into the PIC's flash. Currently I am using a UBW32
breakout board for the PIC, and am using the linux ubw32 program to
load the hex file via a bootloader. 

More information about the bootloading program and the UBW32 itself
